# SQL-RETURN
I recently completed a Diploma cousre with CIMT College where I studied Data Science and Big Data, Due to the level of concentration, learning and studying for the courses examinations, I had to take a break from uploading but I am back and I am taking an SQL question sequence

# CHATGPT QUESTIONIARE
On my return, I asked Chatgpt to give me 40 different SQL questions based on a dataset I got from Kaggle- IMDB TOP 1000 movies dataset.
I asked for the question strategically advancing from beginner to intermediate level of difficulty (1-20) AND intermediate to advanced SQL questions (21-40). 

# BELOW ARE THE QUESTIONS
